This site uses a Let's Encrypt cert.  The cert is valid for 90
days from issue, and must be renewed before that expires.

*** This is required to be done manually. ***

To create a new cert:

1. login  as root to mx.ntpsec.org

2. run ~/Do-certbot-blog

3.  it will run, until it tells you something like this:

# printf "%s" 1G_7ljEupm1uG7F0mJhWDvhAiHeNtCB0iNRpdxB1hZI.QkjTNSDQNkoUxeL1n5tMRVf8qR6vblgNR6MKdG3DdbM > .well-known/acme-challenge/1G_7ljEupm1uG7F0mJhWDvhAiHeNtCB0iNRpdxB1hZI

4. Make a fresh clone of

git@gitlab.com:NTPsec/blog.git

5. cd to the git root, run the printf that certbot gave you.

6. build the site: # jekyll build -d public

7. add the new file: # git add .well-known/acme-challenge/*

8: commit it: # git commit -a

9: push it: # git push

10: wait until the file shows up in:
     https://blog.ntpsec.org/.well-known/acme-challenge/

11. Press enter  to let Do-certbot-blog finish.

12.  Go to GL pages: https://gitlab.com/NTPsec/blog/pages

13. remove blog.ntpsec.org

14. add blog.ntpsec.org, cut/paste in the new fullchain.pem and privkey.pem
