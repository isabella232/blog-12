  The blog for the NTPsec Project.
  NTPsec is a secure, hardened, and improved implementation of Network
  Time Protocol derived from NTP Classic, Dr. David Millsâ€™s original.
  Our goal is to deliver code that can be used with confidence in
  deployments with the most stringent security, availability, and
  assurance requirements.
